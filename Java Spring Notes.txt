Spring:
	 - a very popular framework for building Java applications.
	 - provides a large number of helper classes and annotations.
	 
	 problem in building a traditional spring application:
		 - difficult to choose the jar dependency
		 - choose which configuration to use... xml or java
		 - how to install server... Tomcat, JBoss...
		 
	 - Spring Boot:
		 - Spring Boot makes it easy to work/get started on Spring development
		 - it minimizes the amount of manual configuration
			 - it performs auto-configurations based on props file and jAR classpath
		 - helps to resolve dependency conflicts(Maven or gradle)
		 - provides an embedded http server which supports Tomcat,Jetty, Undertow....
			 - no need to install sever seperately, JAR file will cotain application code and server(ex: mycoolapp.jar)
			 - as spring boot includes an embedded server, apring boot apps can be run standalone
				 - i.e we can run spring boot aps from IDE or command line.
				 
		 - Spring Boot uses Spring behind the scenes and makes it easier to use Spring.
		 
	 - Spring Initializr:
		 - a website/app to quickly create a spring boot project
		 - http://start.spring.io
		 - helps to create maven or gradle project
		 
		 - creating a spring boot project:
			 - go to link http://start.spring.io
			 - Select Project as Maven
			 - Select Language as JAVA
			 - Select Spring Boot version(latest one, avoid selecting snapshot/beta vesrion)
			 - enter the project details and select java version
			 - select dependencies(ex: Spring Web)
			 - Click on Generate to download the zip file.
			 - Unzip the file
			 - Import the maven project in IDE
			 
		 
		 
		 
	 - Deploying Spring Boot apps:
		 - Spring Boot applications can be deployed in traditional ways:
			 - deploy WAR file to an external server: Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere
			 
	 - Spring Boot uses Spring MVC, Spring REST, Spring Core.... in the background(hence it does not replace them)
	 
Maven:
	 - Maven is a utility/framework which is used to automate downlaoding JAR files.
	 - we need to define/specify the type of dependency we need to doenload.
	 - Maven will also add the JAR files to the project classpath.
